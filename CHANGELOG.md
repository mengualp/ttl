and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed
- **macOS: traces no longer collapse to a single hop on fast hardware** (#12). On macOS, `sendto` is asynchronous and the kernel stamps each queued datagram with the socket's *current* TTL at drain time, so rapid per-probe `setsockopt(IP_TTL)` calls could all be sent with the final TTL — leaving only the destination/gateway visible. **All three probe modes (ICMP, UDP, TCP) now send each probe from a fresh socket on macOS**, which is deterministic regardless of hardware speed (the previous fixed 500µs delay only masked the race and was insufficient on some Apple Silicon machines). UDP re-binds each flow's source port with address reuse so Paris/Dublin flow identification and NAT detection are preserved. Root cause reproduced and confirmed via on-wire capture on macOS 26.5.1 (a probe burst leaving with a single repeated TTL). Correlation is unaffected — the receiver matches on the probe sequence / payload-embedded identifier, not the kernel-assigned ICMP identifier.

## [0.20.0] - 2026-06-10

### Added
- **Interactive target selection**: run `ttl` with no arguments to open an empty session, then press `o` to add targets — also works mid-session in any live TUI run. Hostnames resolve in the background with a loading state; probe engines (and receivers, for a new IP family) spawn at runtime. Entering an already-traced host switches to it.
- **Daemon mode** (`--daemon`): headless probing with no per-hop stdout, for container/monitoring deployments. Combine with `--prometheus` and/or `--stream-json` to consume the data.
- **Prometheus exporter** (`--prometheus <ADDR>`, e.g. `:9090`): OpenMetrics endpoint with per-hop sent/response/timeout counters, RTT avg/min/max/stddev gauges, loss ratio, ECMP responder count, hop identity info series, and per-target reachability/path-length metrics. Includes `GET /healthz` for container orchestration. Hand-rolled over the existing tokio runtime — no new dependencies.
- **SIGTERM handling**: `docker stop` now triggers the same graceful shutdown as Ctrl-C (unix).
- **Official Dockerfile**: multi-stage Alpine/musl build producing a minimal image; `.dockerignore` included.
- **GHCR container publishing**: releases now push multi-arch (amd64/arm64) images to `ghcr.io/lance0/ttl`, assembled from the prebuilt static musl release binaries. New `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl` release artifact (also useful for glibc-free arm64 distros).
- **Trace diffing** (`--diff before.json after.json`): compare two saved sessions hop by hop. Reports path changes (primary responder differs), added/lost hops, ECMP responder-set changes, avg RTT deltas (highlighted when ≥5ms and ≥20%), loss changes, and destination reachability. `--json` emits the diff as machine-readable JSON.
- **Streaming JSON output** (`--stream-json`): emit each probe event (reply/timeout/late_reply) as one line of JSON on stdout for piping to jq/grep/monitoring pipelines. Event lines match the saved-session `events` schema with a `target` field added; a per-target `summary` line is emitted at end of stream. Implies `--no-tui`; memory stays bounded on infinite runs.

### Changed
- **IX prefix lookup** now uses a binary radix trie instead of a linear scan: O(prefix_len) per responder IP (≤32/128 node hops) instead of O(n) over ~2,000 PeeringDB prefixes. No behavior change.

### Dependencies
- maxminddb 0.27.3 → 0.28.1, getifs 0.4.0 → 0.6.1, tokio 1.52.1 → 1.52.3, serde_json 1.0.149 → 1.0.150, clap_complete 4.6.3 → 4.6.5

## [0.19.1] - 2026-05-02

### Added
- Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`): `cargo fmt` and `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` on every commit, `cargo test --lib` on every push. Setup documented in CONTRIBUTING.md for both [prek](https://github.com/j178/prek) (fast Rust port) and the original Python `pre-commit`.
- CI: `cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings` now runs on macOS and FreeBSD in addition to Linux. Catches platform-specific cfg-gating regressions before merge.
- README: NetBSD pkgsrc installation instructions; replay controls listed in the Keybindings table.

### Changed
- **hickory-resolver** upgraded 0.25 → 0.26. Internal API migration in DNS/ASN lookup modules — transparent to users.
- **toml** upgraded 0.9 → 1.x. No code changes required.
- CI: `softprops/action-gh-release` upgraded v2 → v3 (Node.js 24 runtime).

### Fixed
- **DNS resolver fallback** (#71): Restored Google DNS fallback when the system resolver builder is constructable but its `build()` step fails. Caught in Copilot review of the hickory 0.26 migration.
- **macOS clippy warnings** (#72): Unused imports and `is_dgram` variable on macOS-only paths, plus three `needless_return` lints in `src/probe/socket.rs`. Contributed by @SSakutaro.
- **FreeBSD/NetBSD dead-code warnings**: DGRAM ICMP socket helpers now cfg-gated to match their call sites.
- **clippy 1.95 lints**: `collapsible_match` in TUI key handlers and `unnecessary_sort_by` in IX prefix sorting.
- **FreeBSD CI**: Install `ca_root_nss` before fetching crates to avoid SSL verification failures from the FreeBSD VM image.

### Security
- **hickory-proto** via hickory-resolver 0.26.1: fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0119 (O(n²) DNS name compression CPU exhaustion). RUSTSEC-2026-0118 (NSEC3 unbounded loop) also no longer applies — ttl does not validate DNSSEC.
- **rustls-webpki** 0.103.13: cumulative fixes for RUSTSEC-2026-0049, 0098, 0099, 0104.
- **aws-lc-sys** 0.39.0: fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0044/0045/0046/0047/0048 (CRL distribution scope, AES-CCM timing side-channel, X.509 wildcard bypass, PKCS7 validation bypass).
- **quinn-proto** 0.11.14: fixes RUSTSEC-2026-0037 (Quinn endpoint DoS — not exploitable in ttl, which only acts as a TLS client).

### Dependencies
- libc 0.2.182 → 0.2.186, tokio 1.49 → 1.50, socket2 0.6.2 → 0.6.3, clap 4.5 → 4.6, clap_complete 4.5 → 4.6, proptest 1.10 → 1.11, chrono 0.4.43 → 0.4.44

## [0.19.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- **Interactive replay controls**: Seek (Left/Right ±500ms, [/] ±5s), speed adjust (+/- ±0.5x, 0.5x–5.0x range), Home/End jump to start/end
- **Replay progress bar**: Shows play state, event count, timeline position, and speed multiplier
- **Replay help section**: Help overlay (`?`) now shows replay-specific keybindings when in replay mode

### Fixed
- **Replay timing precision**: Switched from f32 to f64 for elapsed time calculations to prevent drift on long replays
- **Replay seek safety**: Saturating arithmetic prevents overflow on relative seek; `Instant::checked_sub` prevents underflow on corrupted replay files

## [0.18.2] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed
- **NetBSD UDP probes**: Auto-detect source IP for UDP DGRAM sockets on NetBSD. Fixes "No route to host" (EHOSTUNREACH) when sending UDP probes without `--source-ip` (#47)
- **NetBSD IPv4 PMTUD retry spam**: PMTUD now terminates immediately on first DF flag failure instead of retrying every probe round. Prints a single warning when `IP_DONTFRAG` is unavailable (#47)

## [0.18.1] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **NetBSD platform support** (experimental): Raw sockets, IPv6 PMTUD, BSD minimum inter-probe delay. IPv4 PMTUD unavailable (no `IP_DONTFRAG`). Interface binding (`-i`) not supported. (#47)

### Fixed
- **Update checker reliability**: Changed from blocking `recv_timeout(1s)` to non-blocking `try_recv()` polling in TUI event loop. Update notifications no longer silently drop when GitHub API response exceeds 1 second
- **Update checker first-run**: Set `update-informer` interval to `Duration::ZERO` so first launch performs an immediate network check instead of writing a cache file and waiting for the next run

### Dependencies
- Updated clap (4.5.58→4.5.60), libc (0.2.181→0.2.182), futures (0.3.31→0.3.32), maxminddb (0.27.1→0.27.3), toml_parser (1.0.7→1.0.9), anyhow (1.0.101→1.0.102), plus transitive deps

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **ECMP classification**: Detects per-flow vs per-packet ECMP using primary concentration heuristics. Paths column now accurately reflects observed responder count for per-packet load balancing (#46)
- **`E` indicator**: New ECMP indicator in main table replaces misleading `!` (route flap) when ECMP is the actual cause
- **Effective flow capability**: Runtime detection of protocol flow support. `--flows > 1` with ICMP now warns and collapses to single-flow instead of silently doing nothing
- **Receiver flow attribution hardening**: Out-of-range source ports (NAT/CGNAT) no longer force-attributed to flow 0. Unknown-flow responses only match pending probes when unambiguous
- **Hop detail view**: Per-packet ECMP section shows responder count and path count; per-flow ECMP section unchanged
- **Last RTT semantics documented**: `Last` column tracks primary responder's most recent RTT (code docs + KNOWN_ISSUES)
- **Main table layout guard tests**: Header/cell/width count parity verified across Auto/Compact/Wide x single-flow/multi-flow
- **IPv6 RAW payload fallback tests**: Echo Reply and Time Exceeded parsing tests for IPv6

### Changed
- **Flap detection suppressed during ECMP**: `!` indicator no longer fires when per-packet ECMP is detected at a hop
- **Probe engines use per-session config**: Each target's engine sees the effective flow count, not the raw CLI value

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-12

### Added
- **Last RTT column**: Main table now shows the most recent probe RTT between Sent and Avg, matching mtr's default column order (#17)
- **JAvg and JMax columns**: Jitter average and jitter max columns appear in Wide display mode (press `w`) (#17)
- **CSV columns**: Added `last_ms`, `jitter_avg_ms`, `jitter_max_ms` to CSV export

### Changed
- **CSV schema** (breaking): Header now has 14 columns (was 11). `last_ms` inserted before `avg_ms`; `jitter_avg_ms` and `jitter_max_ms` appended
- **ASN column width**: Increased auto mode cap (30→40 chars) and wide mode width (24→36 chars) to show more of the AS name

### Dependencies
- Updated clap (4.5.54→4.5.58), clap_complete (4.5.65→4.5.66), anyhow (1.0.100→1.0.101), libc (0.2.180→0.2.181), proptest (1.9.0→1.10.0), plus transitive deps

## [0.16.1] - 2026-02-11

### Fixed
- **Hang on exit**: Bounded IPv6 echo-reply drain loop to prevent starvation when socket is continuously readable (#41)
- **Ctrl+C during shutdown**: Ctrl+C now force-exits if cleanup stalls — first press cancels, second press terminates immediately (#41)

### Added
- **Shutdown tracing**: Set `TTL_SHUTDOWN_TRACE=1` to emit `[shutdown]` stage markers for diagnosing exit hangs

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-05

### Changed
- **Immediate sent counting**: Sent counters now increment when probes leave, not when responses arrive. Matches mtr behavior for real-time feedback (#17)

### Fixed
- **FreeBSD ICMP sockets**: FreeBSD doesn't support `SOCK_DGRAM + IPPROTO_ICMP`, now uses RAW sockets directly. Fixes `Protocol not supported` error on FreeBSD (#14)
- **Dual-stack `--resolve-all`**: `--resolve-all` without `-4`/`-6` now traces both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses by spawning dual receivers. Previously silently dropped one address family (#11)
- **IPv6 Echo Reply double-counting**: Fixed sent counter being incremented twice for Linux IPv6 ICMP probes (once at send, once at Echo Reply)

### Removed
- Dead `create_probe_interval()` function

## [0.15.3] - 2026-01-29

### Changed
- **ASN column format**: Now shows `AS##### name` instead of just the name, so ASN number is always visible even when truncated (#17)

### Fixed
- **Sent count consistency**: All pending probes are now counted as timeouts when trace completes, ensuring consistent sent counts across all hops (#37)

## [0.15.2] - 2026-01-28

### Added
- **`--jumbo` flag**: Enable 9216-byte max for PMTUD in jumbo frame environments. Without this flag, PMTUD uses standard 1500-byte ethernet max (#28)

### Fixed
- **PMTUD accuracy**: Standard ethernet (1500 MTU) now reports exact MTU instead of ~1495 (#28)

## [0.15.1] - 2026-01-28

### Fixed
- **TUI lock contention**: Snapshot session data before rendering so no locks are held during draw, fixing UI freezes during rapid target switching (#19)
- **Stat column desync**: Sent counter now updates atomically with Avg/Min/Max/Loss instead of racing ahead (#17)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-01-27

### Added
- **Jumbo frame support**: `--size` now accepts up to 9216 bytes (was 1500) for jumbo frame environments. PMTUD binary search also starts at 9216, discovering jumbo MTUs automatically (#28)
- **Animated replay mode**: `--replay <file> --animate` replays saved sessions showing probe-by-probe discovery instead of final state (#9)
- **Replay speed control**: `--speed` flag controls replay speed (default 10x, use 1.0 for real-time)
- **Probe event recording**: Sessions now record per-probe events with full correlation info (TTL, seq, flow_id, responder, RTT)
- **Replay controls**: Press Space to pause/resume animated replay
- **Late reply tracking**: Responses arriving after timeout are recorded as `late_reply` events for replay accuracy

### Fixed
- **FreeBSD build failure**: Fix `cargo install ttl` on FreeBSD by making `getifs` dependency conditional. Gateway detection unavailable on FreeBSD (uses macOS-specific APIs).
- **Replay timing accuracy**: Events now replay at their recorded timestamps instead of fixed intervals
- **Replay pause/resume**: Resuming no longer causes time jump or skipped events
- **Event timestamp monotonicity**: Use monotonic clock (`Instant`) for event offsets to prevent clock jump issues

### Changed
- **TUI refresh rate**: Increased from 10fps to 60fps for more responsive per-probe updates (#17)
- **CI**: Added FreeBSD 14.2 build testing via vmactions/freebsd-vm

## [0.14.2] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **In-app update notification**: When an update is available, a yellow status bar and banner show the new version. Press 'u' to dismiss.
- **Update command in help**: Help overlay now shows the install-method-aware update command (e.g., `brew upgrade ttl` or `cargo install ttl`)

### Fixed
- **Update notification TLS**: Fix update checker silently failing due to missing TLS support in `ureq` backend

## [0.14.1] - 2026-01-26

### Added
- **FreeBSD support (experimental)**: Basic traceroute now works on FreeBSD 13/14. Requires `sudo`. Interface binding (`-i`) is not supported due to missing kernel APIs.

### Changed
- **Resolver behavior**: Target resolution now follows OS resolver order (respects `/etc/gai.conf` on Linux). Use `-4` or `-6` to force a specific IP family. (PR #24 by @n-thumann)
- **Target list number keys**: Pressing 1-9 now selects and closes the dialog in one action

### Fixed
- **Target list lockup**: Fix lock contention when selecting target from list overlay (#19)
- **Export lock contention**: Clone session data before file I/O to avoid blocking receiver thread
- **Hop navigation lock contention**: Extract hop count in scoped block before updating UI state
- **Hop detail modal truncation**: Modal now dynamically sizes to content, preventing help text cutoff

### Performance
- **Status bar allocation**: Use `Cow<str>` to avoid string allocation on every frame

## [0.14.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added
- **Update notifications**: Checks GitHub releases for new versions (daily, cached). Shows install-method-aware update command on exit when a new version is available. Only displays on TTY.

### Changed
- **Gateway detection via kernel APIs**: Replaced subprocess-based route detection with direct kernel API calls (netlink on Linux, sysctl on macOS). Instant startup even on DFZ routers with millions of routes (#16)

### Fixed
- **DFZ router startup hang**: Gateway detection no longer shells out to `ip route` which could hang on systems with large routing tables (#16)

## [0.13.4] - 2026-01-24

### Added
- **Hop detail navigation**: Use Up/Down/k/j to navigate between hops while detail view is open, 1-9 to jump directly (#18)
- **Version in help**: Help overlay now shows version number in title (#22)

### Fixed
- **PMTUD accuracy**: Trust ICMP-reported MTU directly per RFC 1191, fixing 6-byte underreporting (#23)

## [0.13.3] - 2026-01-23

### Fixed
- **UI lockup with multiple targets**: Target list overlay no longer blocks receiver thread (#19)
- **Startup hang on routers with large routing tables**: Route detection commands now timeout after 2 seconds (#16)
- **PMTUD probes inflating hop statistics**: PMTUD probes no longer count toward hop sent/received stats (#21)

## [0.13.2] - 2026-01-22

### Fixed
- **macOS**: Increase inter-probe delay from 200µs to 500µs to eliminate remaining TTL batching issues (#12)
- Fix clippy warning with Rust 1.93+

## [0.13.0] - 2026-01-21

### Added
- **Multi-IP resolution** (`--resolve-all`): Trace all resolved IP addresses for hostnames
  - Round-robin DNS (multiple A records) now traceable with single command
  - Dual-stack hosts (A + AAAA) supported - compares IPv4 vs IPv6 paths
  - Automatic deduplication by IP with hostname aliasing
  - Prefers IPv4 by default, falls back to IPv6 if no IPv4 addresses
  - Skip warnings show how many addresses were filtered (e.g., "3 IPv6 skipped")
  - Title bar shows `hostname -> IP` format when tracing resolved hostnames
- **Target list overlay** (`l` key): Overview of all resolved targets in multi-target mode
  - Shows IP address, hostname, hop count, and loss percentage for each target
  - Navigate with Up/Down or j/k, select with Enter, jump with 1-9
  - Only available when multiple targets are being traced
- **Settings modal** (`s` key): Configure theme, display mode, and PeeringDB API key
  - Live preview of theme changes
  - Display mode selector (auto/compact/wide) for column widths
  - PeeringDB API key input with text editing support
  - Cache status display (prefix count, age, expiry indicator)
  - Press `r` in PeeringDB section to refresh cache
  - Settings persist to config file on exit
- **PeeringDB API key persistence**: API key saved to `~/.config/ttl/config.toml`
  - Environment variable `PEERINGDB_API_KEY` still takes precedence over saved key
- **Wide mode CLI flag** (`--wide`): Start with wide (generous column widths) mode
- **Autosize columns** (`w` key): Intelligent column width control
  - **Auto mode** (default): Columns auto-fit to longest hostname/ASN content
  - **Compact mode**: Minimal column widths (host: 20, ASN: 12)
  - **Wide mode**: Generous column widths (host: 45, ASN: 24)
  - Press `w` to cycle: auto → compact → wide → auto
  - Long hostnames like `po-300-xar01.alexandria.va.bad.comcast.net` display fully in auto mode
  - Maximum caps prevent layout blowout (host: 60 chars, ASN: 30 chars)
  - Display mode persisted to `~/.config/ttl/config.toml`

### Changed
- Status bar shows `l list` hint when multiple targets are available
- Status bar shows `w display` hint for cycling display modes
- Help overlay updated with `s` (Settings), `l` (Target list), and `w` (Display mode) keybindings
- Settings modal now shows "Display Mode" selector instead of "Wide Mode" toggle
- **Intel Mac binaries restored**: Pre-built x86_64-apple-darwin binaries available again
  - TTL batching bug (#12) was likely the cause of previous Intel Mac issues
  - Uses new `macos-15-intel` GitHub Actions runner

### Fixed
- **macOS: Probes sent with wrong TTL in initial burst** (#12)
  - Rapid `setsockopt(IP_TTL)` calls were batched by macOS kernel
  - First N probes sent with same TTL, causing only 1 hop to display
  - Added 200µs minimum delay between probes on macOS to ensure TTL changes take effect
  - Workaround: `--rate` flag also fixes this by adding delay between probes

## [0.12.8] - 2026-01-19

### Fixed
- Fix cargo fmt in integration tests (no functional changes from 0.12.7)

## [0.12.7] - 2026-01-19 [YANKED]

### Fixed
- **Non-responding hops frozen after destination found**: Hops showing `* * *` now continue
  to be probed after destination is discovered, matching mtr/trippy behavior
  - Previously, `Sent` counters froze on non-responding hops after completion
  - Now probes all TTLs up to destination every round
  - Allows detecting hops that recover from rate limiting

### Added
- **Ctrl+C to quit TUI**: Now handles Ctrl+C (and ETX) in addition to `q`
- **`[max_ttl=30]` warning**: Title bar shows warning when destination not found
  and using default max_ttl of 30; hints to try `--max-ttl 64` for long paths

### Changed
- More probes sent after destination found (all TTLs probed each round)
  - Bounded by `dest_ttl`, not `max_ttl`
  - Matches mtr/trippy probing behavior

## [0.12.6] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **ICMPv6 checksum computation**: Fix IPv6 traceroute not detecting destinations
  - ICMPv6 packets had checksum 0, relying on kernel to fill it in (it didn't)
  - Destinations dropped packets with invalid checksums; intermediate hops worked
  - Added manual ICMPv6 checksum computation with RFC 8200 pseudo-header
  - Algorithm derived from trippy (BSD-licensed) with known-value test verification
  - Socket now bound to source IP for IPv6 to ensure checksum consistency

### Improved
- **IPv6 address display**: Increased width for full IPv6 addresses
  - TUI host column: 28 → 42 chars for IPv6 (prevents truncation)
  - Text report host column: 40 → 46 chars

## [0.12.5] - 2026-01-18

### Fixed
- **IPv6 ICMP traceroute**: Fix 100% packet loss on Linux for destination hop
  - Linux delivers ICMPv6 Echo Reply only to the socket that sent the request
  - Added send socket polling for Echo Reply in IPv6 ICMP mode (Linux-only)
  - Intermediate hops (Time Exceeded) were unaffected; only destination detection was broken
  - ICMPv6 Echo Request now uses correct type 128 (was incorrectly using type 8)

### Improved
- **Hop detail dialog**: Add `Enter` and `q` keys to close dialog (PR #6 by @themoog)
  - `Enter` now toggles the dialog (open and close)
  - `q` provides familiar quit-key for TUI users
  - Improves accessibility for users with non-functional Escape keys

### Changed
- **Cargo.lock**: Now tracked in version control for reproducible builds
  - Best practice for binary applications per Cargo documentation
  - Enables deterministic builds for package managers (nixpkgs, etc.)

## [0.12.4] - 2026-01-17

### Fixed
- **Linux binary compatibility**: Switch x86_64 builds to musl libc
  - Pre-built binaries now work on Debian 11/12 and other older distros
  - Previously required glibc 2.39 (Ubuntu 24.04+), now fully static

## [0.12.3] - 2026-01-16

### Fixed
- **Hop detail view stats**: Fixed "Sent: 0" display bug in hop detail panel
  - Hop detail now correctly shows hop-level sent/received/loss stats
  - Previously showed per-responder `sent` (always 0) instead of hop-level `sent`
  - Note: Per-responder sent can't be tracked (we don't know which responder will reply before sending)

## [0.12.2] - 2026-01-16

### Improved
- **Quick Start documentation**: Made Linux `setcap` command more prominent
  - Shows how to run without sudo on Linux after one-time capability setup
  - Clarifies macOS always requires sudo

## [0.12.1] - 2026-01-16

### Security
- **Terminal injection protection**: Sanitize DNS hostnames, ASN names, and IX info before display
  - Filters control characters from external data sources (PTR records, Team Cymru, PeeringDB)
  - Prevents malicious terminal escape sequences from affecting the TUI

### Fixed
- **--count semantics**: `-c N` now sends N probe rounds (one probe per TTL), not N × max_ttl probes
  - Each round sends probes to all active TTLs in a single interval
  - Behavior now matches user expectations: `-c 10` = 10 rounds of probing
  - Updated help text to clarify "probe rounds" semantics
- **Port overflow validation**: `--src-port` + `--flows` combination now correctly validated
  - Fixed off-by-one: ports 65520 + 16 flows (max port 65535) now accepted
  - Clear error message shows the computed maximum port number
- **Sequence wrap prevention**: Reject `--timeout` > 256 × `--interval`
  - ProbeId uses u8 sequence (0-255), wraps every 256 intervals
  - Validation prevents mis-correlation when old probes outlive sequence wrap
- **Dead code removal**: Removed unused `recv_icmp_for_udp` function

### Changed
- **Dependencies updated**:
  - hickory-resolver 0.24 → 0.25
  - socket2 0.5 → 0.6
  - reqwest 0.12 → 0.13
  - dirs 5.0 → 6.0
  - toml 0.8 → 0.9
  - ipnetwork 0.20 → 0.21
  - Removed unused `thiserror` dependency

### Technical
- Added `sanitize_display()` helper in lookup module for control character filtering
- Added 5 CLI validation tests for port overflow and timeout/interval checks
- All three probe modes (ICMP, UDP, TCP) now track `rounds_completed` for consistent `-c` behavior

## [0.12.0] - 2026-01-16

### Added
- **Shell completions**: Generate completions for bash, zsh, fish, and powershell via `--completions <shell>`
- **WSL2 documentation**: Added Windows via WSL2 installation guide to README

### Improved
- Document `PEERINGDB_API_KEY` environment variable for higher API rate limits
- Extract `RECENT_WINDOW_SIZE` constant for cleaner code
- Better documentation for rate limit detection edge cases

## [0.11.5] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Linux permission error**: Fail fast with clear instructions (setcap or sudo) instead of silently falling back to broken unprivileged mode

## [0.11.4] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **Multi-target response misattribution**: Fix bug where responses could be attributed to wrong target when tracing multiple destinations concurrently
  - Extract original destination IP from quoted ICMP error packets for direct lookup
  - Use responder IP for Echo Reply disambiguation (responder IS the target)
  - Eliminates ambiguous linear target iteration

### Changed
- **MSG_CTRUNC detection**: Return `None` TTL when control message is truncated to prevent unreliable asymmetry detection
- **IPv6 permission check on Linux**: Warn if IPv6 sockets unavailable (mirrors macOS behavior)
- **macOS CI**: Add macOS test job to catch platform-specific issues before release

### Improved
- Remove panic-able `unwrap()` from MPLS label parsing (use direct array conversion)

## [0.11.3] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- **macOS Sequoia (15) support**: Document as "build from source" only
  - Pre-built binaries are built on Tahoe (26) and may have display issues on Sequoia
  - Users on macOS 15 should use `cargo install ttl` to compile from source
  - Updated README Platform Support table to clarify compatibility

## [0.11.2] - 2026-01-15

### Changed
- Switch macOS build to `macos-latest` runner (Tahoe 26)
  - Did not resolve Sequoia compatibility (see 0.11.3)

## [0.11.1] - 2026-01-15

### Fixed
- **macOS traceroute 100% packet loss**: Fix ICMP traceroute showing all hops as `* * *`
  - DGRAM ICMP sockets cannot receive ICMP Time Exceeded messages from intermediate routers
  - Now uses RAW socket for receiving (can receive all ICMP types) while keeping DGRAM for sending (supports IP_TTL)
  - Added payload-based correlation fallback for RAW receive paths (fixes 100% loss when macOS kernel modifies ICMP identifier)
  - Requires `sudo` on macOS since RAW sockets need root privileges
  - Clear error message when run without elevated privileges
- **Linux unprivileged ICMP**: Restore support for unprivileged ICMP sockets (broken in v0.11.0)
  - Linux users with `ping_group_range` enabled can run without sudo
  - Falls back to DGRAM sockets when RAW sockets are unavailable
- **IPv6 DGRAM availability check**: Warn on macOS if IPv6 DGRAM sockets are unavailable

## [0.11.0] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **macOS traceroute**: Fix ICMP traceroute showing only 1 hop on macOS
  - Use `SOCK_DGRAM` instead of `SOCK_RAW` for ICMP sockets on macOS
  - macOS raw sockets don't support `IP_TTL` setsockopt, preventing TTL manipulation
  - DGRAM sockets allow setting TTL per-packet for proper traceroute functionality
  - Added DGRAM-aware packet parsing (no IP header in received packets)
  - Embedded ProbeId in ICMP payload for correlation fallback (macOS may override identifier)

## [0.10.3] - 2026-01-14

### Changed
- **Platform support**: Drop Intel Mac (x86_64-apple-darwin) binaries - Apple Silicon only
  - Intel Macs can still build from source via `cargo install ttl`

## [0.10.2] - 2026-01-14

### Fixed
- **Cross-compilation**: Switch from native-tls to rustls-tls to avoid OpenSSL dependency for aarch64 builds
- **macOS build**: Fix `msg_controllen` type mismatch (u32 vs usize)
- **Deprecation warning**: Use `bind_device_by_index_v4` instead of deprecated `bind_device_by_index`

## [0.10.1] - 2026-01-14

### Added
- **CLI examples in help**: `--help` now shows usage examples and detection indicator legend
- **Smoke test script**: `tests/smoke.sh` for cross-platform verification

## [0.10.0] - 2026-01-13

**Highlights**: Path MTU discovery, ICMP rate limit detection, route flap detection, asymmetric routing detection, TTL manipulation detection, and CI/CD automation. Major release for network diagnostic capabilities.

### Added
- **Path MTU discovery** (`--pmtud`): Binary search to find maximum unfragmented packet size
  - Uses DF (Don't Fragment) flag to detect MTU limits
  - Binary search algorithm: starts at 1500, converges to within 8 bytes
  - Shows progress in TUI title bar: `[MTU: min-max]` during search, `[MTU: X]` when complete
  - Extracts MTU from ICMP Fragmentation Needed (IPv4 Type 3 Code 4) and ICMPv6 Packet Too Big (Type 2)
  - Handles EMSGSIZE errors for local interface MTU limits
  - Requires 2 consecutive successes or failures before moving binary search bounds (handles network flakiness)
  - IPv4 minimum: 68 bytes (RFC 791), IPv6 minimum: 1280 bytes (RFC 8200)
  - Conflicts with `--size` (mutually exclusive)
- **Packet size control** (`--size`): Set probe packet size for MTU testing
  - Range: 36-1500 bytes for IPv4, 56-1500 bytes for IPv6
  - Total packet size includes IP header (20/40 bytes) + protocol header + payload
  - Packets sent with DF (Don't Fragment) flag for proper MTU discovery
  - Works with all probe protocols (ICMP, UDP, TCP)
- **DSCP/ToS marking** (`--dscp`): Set IP header DSCP field (0-63) for QoS policy testing
  - DSCP 46 = Expedited Forwarding (EF) for VoIP traffic
  - DSCP 34 = AF41 for video traffic
  - Useful for testing QoS policies and seeing where traffic gets remarked
  - Works with all probe protocols (ICMP, UDP, TCP)
  - Supports both IPv4 (TOS) and IPv6 (Traffic Class)
- **GitHub Actions CI**: Automated build, test, clippy, and format checks on PRs
  - Runs on ubuntu-latest for all pushes to master and PRs
  - Strict clippy (`-D warnings`) catches issues before merge
- **Binary releases**: Automated builds on version tags via GitHub Actions
  - Linux x86_64 and aarch64 (cross-compiled)
  - macOS x86_64 (Intel) and aarch64 (Apple Silicon)
  - Pre-built binaries attached to GitHub releases
  - SHA256 checksums included for verification
  - cargo-audit security check before release
- **Rate limiting** (`--rate`): Limit probes per second to avoid triggering router rate limits
  - Useful for slow links or avoiding overwhelming targets
  - `--rate 0` = unlimited (default), `--rate 10` = 10 probes/sec max
  - Global limit applies across all flows
- **Source IP selection** (`--source-ip`): Force probes to use a specific source IP address
  - Useful for multi-homed hosts with multiple IPs
  - Works with all probe protocols (ICMP, UDP, TCP)
  - Validates source IP family matches target family
- **ICMP rate limit detection**: Identify when routers are rate-limiting ICMP responses
  - Detects misleading packet loss caused by router rate limiting (not actual packet drops)
  - Three detection heuristics:
    1. **Isolated hop loss**: Loss at hop N but 0% loss downstream = rate limiting
    2. **Uniform flow loss**: All flows losing equally in Paris/Dublin mode = hop-level limiting
    3. **Stable loss ratio**: Consistent loss percentage over time = rate limiting (vs fluctuating congestion)
  - Loss% column shows "RL" suffix (e.g., "50%RL") when rate limiting suspected
  - Title bar shows `[RL?]` indicator when any hop has rate limiting detected
  - Hop detail view shows detection reason, confidence level, and mitigation tip
  - Tip suggests slower probing with `-i 1.0` or `-i 2.0` to avoid triggering limits
  - Detection automatically clears when loss drops below threshold
- **First-hop gateway detection**: Display source IP and default gateway in TUI
  - Shows routing info in title bar: `eth0 (192.168.1.100 → 192.168.1.1)`
  - Auto-detects default gateway from system routing table
  - Works with or without `--interface` flag
  - Parses `ip route show` on Linux, `route -n get default` on macOS
  - Gateway info also populated when using `--interface` option
- **Route flap detection**: Detect when primary responder IP changes at a hop
  - Indicates routing instability in single-flow mode
  - Main table shows "!" after hostname when flaps detected
  - Hop detail view shows route change history (last 5 changes)
  - Uses sticky tie-breaker with margin (requires new IP to exceed old by 2+ responses)
  - Minimum 5 responses before recording flaps (avoids startup noise)
  - Disabled in multi-flow mode (`--flows > 1`) where path changes are expected
  - History capped at 50 changes per hop
- **Asymmetric routing detection**: Detect when return path differs from forward path
  - Extracts response TTL from ICMP packets using `recvmsg()` with `IP_RECVTTL`/`IPV6_RECVHOPLIMIT`
  - Estimates return hops using common initial TTL defaults (64, 128, 255)
  - Compares forward TTL vs estimated return hops to detect asymmetry
  - Flags asymmetry when difference >= 3 hops in >50% of samples (minimum 5 samples)
  - Title bar shows `[ASYM]` indicator when any hop has asymmetric routing detected
  - Main table shows "~" after hostname when asymmetry suspected at that hop
  - Hop detail view shows routing symmetry section: forward hops, return hops, confidence
  - High variance in return hops suggests return-path ECMP
  - Disabled in multi-flow mode (like route flap detection)
- **TTL manipulation detection**: Detect middleboxes that modify IP TTL values
  - Analyzes quoted TTL in ICMP Time Exceeded (code 0) responses only
  - Code 0 = TTL exceeded in transit; code 1 = fragment reassembly exceeded (ignored)
  - Per RFC 1812, quoted TTL should be 0 or 1 (post-decrement or pre-decrement)
  - Detects: transparent proxies (quoted TTL == sent TTL), abnormal quoted TTL > 1
  - Hop 1 guard: avoids false positive when sent_ttl=1 and quoted_ttl=1 (normal pre-decrement)
  - Title bar shows `[TTL!]` indicator when manipulation detected
  - Main table shows "^" after hostname at affected hops
  - Hop detail view shows: sent TTL, last quoted TTL, normal/anomalous sample counts
  - Works in both single-flow and multi-flow modes (unlike asymmetry/flap detection)
  - Hysteresis clearing resets anomaly counters to prevent re-triggering

### Fixed
- **PeeringDB pagination**: Added `limit=0` to API requests to fetch all IX records
  - Without this, only the first page of results was cached, missing many IX detections
- **PeeringDB User-Agent**: Added proper User-Agent header to avoid 403 Forbidden responses
- **PeeringDB API key support**: Set `PEERINGDB_API_KEY` env var for higher rate limits
  - Anonymous API access is rate-limited (1/hour for large queries)
  - API key authentication provides 40 requests/minute
- **IX lookup race condition**: Use `OnceCell::get_or_try_init` for thread-safe lazy loading
  - Previously, concurrent lookups could trigger multiple parallel API fetches
  - `get_or_try_init` only fills cell on success, allowing retries after backoff on failure
- **IX lookup failure backoff**: Skip retries for 5 minutes after load failure
  - Prevents log spam and repeated API hits on unstable networks
- **Longest prefix match**: Sort prefixes by length descending for correct matching
  - Previously returned first match; now returns most specific (longest) prefix
- **Rate limit reset**: `reset_stats` now clears rate limit detection state
  - Previously RL warnings could persist after reset or replay
- **Stable loss ratio calculation**: Fixed segment length calculation for non-divisible window sizes
  - Previously third segment used wrong divisor, skewing detection
- **Rate limit clearing hysteresis**: Require 2 consecutive negative checks before clearing
  - Also clears when downstream loss rises above 10% (isolated loss no longer applies)
  - Force clears after 5 negatives regardless (signal gone if heuristics stop matching)
  - Prevents UI flicker while ensuring stale RL doesn't linger
- **Stable-loss uses recent window**: Detection now uses recent_results loss, not lifetime
  - Fixes sticky RL during recovery when lifetime loss is still high but recent is 0%
- **PMTUD probe ID collision**: Added `is_pmtud` flag to pending map key
  - Completely eliminates collision between normal and PMTUD probes with same ProbeId
- **PMTUD consecutive counter logic**: Direction changes now reset opposite counter
  - Ensures 2 truly consecutive results before advancing binary search bounds
- **PMTUD response size verification**: Only process responses matching current probe size
  - Ignores late responses from previous probe sizes that could corrupt state
- **IPv6 Packet Too Big handling**: Added dedicated `PacketTooBig` enum variant
  - ICMPv6 Type 2 now correctly triggers PMTUD MTU clamping
- **Multi-target JSON output**: Multiple targets now wrapped in JSON array
  - Previously output invalid JSON (concatenated objects without delimiters)
- **TUI pause state sync**: Switching targets now syncs pause indicator with target's state
  - Previously pause indicator could be stale after Tab/n target switch

### Changed
- **Dependencies updated**: ratatui 0.28→0.30, crossterm 0.28→0.29, maxminddb 0.24→0.27
  - Fixes RUSTSEC-2025-0132 (maxminddb unsafe memmap), RUSTSEC-2024-0436 (paste unmaintained)

- JSON export includes rate limit data via serde
- IX lookup uses `tokio::sync::OnceCell` for thread-safe lazy initialization
- Refactored `Receiver::new()` and `spawn_receiver()` to use `ReceiverConfig` struct (9 args → 4 args)
- Renamed internal `fixed_port` field to `port_fixed` for Rust naming consistency
- Gateway detection: `detect_gateway_ipv4()` and `detect_gateway_ipv6()` in `interface.rs`
- Gateway detection: `detect_default_gateway()` for auto-detected interface routing
- `InterfaceInfo` extended with `gateway_ipv4` and `gateway_ipv6` fields

  - Requires `--interface` to be set
  - Disables receiver socket binding to interface
  - Allows receiving replies on any interface (for asymmetric routing, VPN scenarios)
  - Send sockets remain bound to the specified interface

### Fixed
- **IPv6 interface detection**: Fixed bug where global IPv6 addresses were incorrectly rejected
  - The link-local check used bitwise NOT (`!v6.segments()[0]`) instead of comparison (`!=`)
  - Global IPv6 addresses like `2001:db8::1` now correctly detected on dual-stack interfaces
- **Link-local only rejection**: Non-loopback interfaces with only link-local IPv6 now return clear error
  - Link-local addresses require scope IDs and can't reach Internet targets
  - Error message explains the issue and suggests assigning a global address
- **Auto-protocol UDP binding**: Auto-protocol mode now tests UDP with interface binding
  - Previously could select UDP even if interface binding would fail later
  - Now fails fast with clear error instead of confusing runtime failure

### Technical

## [0.6.1] - 2026-01-13

### Fixed
- **Enrichment in batch/streaming modes**: DNS, ASN, and GeoIP lookups now work in `--json`, `--report`, `--csv`, and `--no-tui` modes
  - Previously enrichment workers only spawned in interactive TUI mode
  - Batch mode waits for enrichment to settle before export
  - Streaming mode shows hostnames progressively as DNS resolves
- **Terminal state restoration**: TUI now properly restores terminal on early errors or panics
  - Added `scopeguard::defer!` guard to ensure cleanup runs on all exit paths
  - Prevents terminal being left in raw/alternate screen mode on crash

### Technical
- Added `scopeguard = "1"` dependency for cleanup guards
- `run_batch_mode()` and `run_streaming_mode()` now spawn enrichment workers
- Streaming output includes hostname column when resolved

## [0.6.0] - 2026-01-12

- **Source port extraction**: ICMP error parsing extracts original source port for flow correlation

### Fixed
- **Loss percentage "pulsing"**: Fixed visual glitch where loss would pulse on each hop
  - Loss now calculated from completed probes only: `timeouts / (received + timeouts)`
  - In-flight probes no longer count as temporary losses
  - Added `timeouts` counter to `Hop` struct for accurate tracking

### Technical
- Multi-flow UDP probing: Creates separate bound sockets per flow
- Multi-flow TCP probing: Varies source port in raw SYN packets
- Flow ID tracked in `PendingProbe` for response correlation
- `ParsedResponse.src_port` field for flow identification from ICMP errors
- `PendingMap` keyed by `(ProbeId, flow_id)` to prevent multi-flow entry collisions
- Flow derivation validates port range to avoid mis-attribution from NAT rewrites
- Backward compatible: `--flows 1` (default) = identical to previous behavior

### Known Limitations
- NAT devices may rewrite source ports, causing multi-flow correlation to fail (responses will appear as losses)

### Fixed
- **Startup false drops**: Fixed race condition where fast ICMP responses arrived before probe was registered
  - Shared pending map with insert-before-send eliminates registration race
  - Socket drain before timeout cleanup prevents dropping queued responses
- Improved accuracy for low-latency first hops
- **ASN TXT parsing**: Fixed handling of quoted/split TXT records from Team Cymru DNS

### Documentation
- **Jitter semantics**: Clarified that jitter measures RTT variance, not inter-packet timing

  - Internal (crate-only): `cli`, `lookup`, `probe`, `trace`, `tui` modules
  - Binary still has full access to all modules

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-12
