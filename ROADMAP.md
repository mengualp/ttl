# ttl Roadmap

## Market Context

**mtr is the de facto standard** for interactive traceroute but hasn't seen major feature development in years. **trippy** (Rust) is the main modern alternative but focuses on a different feature set.

**Key advantages ttl already has:**
- ECMP path enumeration with per-flow/per-packet classification (`--flows`)
- NAT detection (source port rewrite analysis)
- ICMP rate limit detection (distinguish rate limiting from real loss)
- Route flap and asymmetric routing detection
- TTL manipulation detection (transparent proxies, middleboxes)
- Path MTU discovery (`--pmtud`)
- IX detection via PeeringDB
- Animated session replay
- Dual-stack `--resolve-all` (trace IPv4 and IPv6 simultaneously)

---

## Completed (v0.1.x - v0.6.x)

- [x] ICMP Echo probing with TTL sweep

## Planned Features

### Next — ECMP Improvements

**Why this matters:** Per-packet load balancing (common on Arista, Juniper, Cisco) is undercounted by the current flow-primary model. Users see 8 responders in the detail view but "Paths: 1" in the main table. Related: #46

- [x] Detect per-packet vs per-flow ECMP (primary_ratio heuristic per flow)
- [x] Paths column reflects actual responder count for per-packet ECMP
- [x] Separate indicators: `E` for ECMP detected vs `!` for route flap
- [x] Warn when `--flows > 1` with effective ICMP probing (`-p icmp`, or `-p auto` when auto-select resolves to ICMP)
- [x] Define `-p auto` warning semantics for multi-target/mixed-family runs (warn if any target resolves to effective ICMP, avoid duplicate spam)
- [x] Track effective flow capability at runtime (requested `--flows` vs effective protocol) and use it for flap detection + NAT/Paths column visibility
- [x] Add CLI/TUI hint that flow-based ECMP detection is meaningful with UDP/TCP probes
- [x] Keep Paths value + highlight + host indicator driven by one shared ECMP classification (avoid count/style drift)
- [x] Handle out-of-range returned src ports as unknown flow (not forced flow 0) to avoid false per-flow attribution behind NAT/CGNAT
- [x] Update indicator/UI budget for new `E` marker (host width autosize currently assumes `" !~^"`)
- [x] Update user-facing indicator docs/help (`E` vs `!`) in CLI help + docs pages
- [x] Add tests for per-packet ECMP classification, `-p auto` ICMP warning behavior, and out-of-range src-port flow attribution
- [x] #46 acceptance: per-packet ECMP no longer presents as misleading `Paths: 1` when many responders are observed
- [x] #46 acceptance: `E` (ECMP) and `!` (route flap) are no longer conflated in the same scenario
- [ ] Paris strategy for UDP (`--strategy paris` — fixed 5-tuple, checksum encodes sequence) *(follow-on after #46 core fix)*
- [ ] Dublin strategy for UDP (`--strategy dublin` — IP ID field encodes sequence) *(follow-on after #46 core fix)*

### Trace Diffing & Streaming

**Why this matters:** Users frequently need to compare traces taken at different times (before/after a change, during/after an incident). Streaming output enables integration with monitoring pipelines.

- [x] Trace comparison (`ttl --diff trace1.json trace2.json`)
- [x] Show added/removed/changed hops between two sessions
- [x] Highlight latency and path changes
- [x] Streaming JSON output (`--stream-json`) for piping to other tools
- [x] Line-delimited JSON (one event per line, composable with jq/grep)

### Docker & Daemon Mode

**Why this matters:** Containerized infrastructure needs lightweight, headless traceroute for continuous path monitoring and integration with Prometheus/Grafana.

- [x] Official Dockerfile (minimal image, NET_RAW capability)
- [x] `--daemon` mode (no TUI, lightweight, SIGINT/SIGTERM handling)
- [x] Prometheus/OpenMetrics exporter (`--prometheus :9090`)
- [x] Health check endpoint for container orchestration (`/healthz`)

### Interactive Target Selection

**Why this matters:** Power users want to add and manage targets without restarting. This makes ttl a persistent network investigation tool.

- [ ] `ttl` with no args enters interactive mode
- [ ] Press `o` to open target input modal
- [ ] Text input with hostname/IP validation
- [ ] DNS resolution with loading state
- [ ] Add additional targets mid-session
- [ ] Empty state UI: "Press 'o' to add target"

## Future Ideas

*Prioritized by effort vs user impact. Quick wins first, then bigger lifts.*

### Quick Wins (low effort, high impact)
- [x] **Progress indicator in replay** — show position in timeline during animated replay
- [x] **Interactive replay** — step through events, jump to time, speed control
- [x] **Last metric semantics** — documented as primary-responder-most-recent; TUI/CSV aligned
- [x] **IPv6 RAW payload fallback tests** — unit tests for IPv6 Echo Reply and Time Exceeded parsing
- [x] **Main table layout tests** — verify header/cell/width count parity across Auto/Compact/Wide × single-flow/multi-flow modes

### Medium Effort (moderate effort, high impact)
- [ ] **PCAP export** — write probe/response packets to .pcap for Wireshark analysis
- [ ] **IX lookup performance** — radix trie for O(prefix_len) instead of O(n) linear scan
- [ ] **Customizable columns** — choose which stats to display in TUI
- [ ] **Docker Hub image** — pre-built container for CI/monitoring pipelines

### Larger Projects (high effort, high impact)
- [ ] **ICMP checksum flow variation** — Paris traceroute for ICMP (vary checksum to create distinct flows). Neither ttl nor trippy implements this today. Requires platform-specific raw socket work (kernel checksum offloading on Linux, IP_HDRINCL). **Note:** Real-world value may be limited — Arista hardware flow-hashing platforms don't use ICMP checksum as entropy, so this approach won't create distinct flows on most switch hardware. TCP/UDP remain the reliable methods for multi-path detection. May still be useful on software load balancers.
- [ ] **BGP & routing integration** — looking glass queries, AS path display, RPKI/ROA validation
- [ ] **Baseline comparison** — save baseline, alert on latency/loss/path deviations
- [ ] **Continuous logging mode** — log path changes over hours/days
- [ ] **Historical data storage** — SQLite/file-based path history

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Custom keybindings** — user-configurable key mappings
- [ ] **World map visualization** — ASCII/Unicode geographic path display
- [ ] **Advanced protocol testing** — TCP MSS clamping, ECN, fragmentation testing
- [ ] **Multi-path validation** — verify all ECMP paths are functional

## Pre-1.0 Requirements

### Code Quality
- [ ] Library API stabilization (stable `lib.rs` for third-party integrations)
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for library consumers
- [ ] Semantic versioning commitment

### Testing
- [x] Integration tests for probe-receive-state pipeline
- [x] Property-based/fuzz tests for packet parsing (correlate.rs)
- [x] RAW payload fallback unit tests (IPv4)
- [x] IPv6 RAW payload fallback unit tests
- [x] Concurrent multi-target stress tests

---

## Low Priority

### Windows Native
- [ ] Basic ICMP traceroute (Npcap or Winsock raw sockets)
- [ ] TUI compatibility with Windows Terminal
- [ ] Pre-built binaries

*Rationale: Massive Npcap effort. WSL2 works well. Revisit if demand warrants.*

### Bidirectional Probing
- [ ] Remote agent for measuring both directions
- [ ] One-way delay estimation (detect latency asymmetry)

*Rationale: Requires deploying an agent on the remote side, which changes the tool's simplicity model.*

### Advanced Network Analysis
- [ ] Bandwidth/capacity estimation (pathchar-style probing)
- [ ] SNMP integration (query router interface stats)
- [ ] Network topology learning (build graph from multiple traces)

*Rationale: These push ttl toward being a full network management tool. Better served by purpose-built tools.*

## Scope Creep / Non-Goals

ttl is a **CLI traceroute tool**. The following are explicitly out of scope:

- **Web/mobile UI** — this is a CLI tool, SSH into a box
- **Shareable URLs / hosted trace service** — JSON files are the sharing format
- **Webhook/event streaming** — use `--stream-json | curl` instead
- **Monitor mode with alerting** — use Smokeping/Nagios for long-running monitoring
- **Modular output plugins** — Unix pipes are the plugin system
- **Hop privacy mode** (mask IPs for screenshots) — users can redact manually
- **Multi-language TUI** (i18n) — English-only is fine for CLI tools
- **Full packet capture** — use tcpdump/wireshark
- **Bandwidth testing** — use [xfr](https://github.com/lance0/xfr) or iperf
- **Port scanning** — use nmap
- **Enterprise collaboration platform** — not a SaaS product

If you need these features, combine ttl with purpose-built tools.
